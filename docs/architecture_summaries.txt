Agent Architecture Implementation Summary
Below is a summary of how each agent architecture was implemented in the Harkaam framework:
1. OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)
Implementation Overview:

Follows the military-inspired decision cycle with four distinct phases
Maintains a cyclical process that repeats until task completion
Strong focus on gathering and analyzing information before making decisions

Key Components:

Observe: Gathers information about the task and environment
Orient: Analyzes the information and forms a mental model
Decide: Makes a decision based on the mental model
Act: Executes the decision (often using tools)

Use Cases:

Dynamic environments requiring constant reassessment
Tasks with changing conditions or requirements
Situations where situational awareness is critical

2. BDI (Belief, Desire, Intention)
Implementation Overview:

Models the agent's mental state through beliefs, desires, and intentions
Provides a structured approach to goal-oriented reasoning
Maintains coherent internal state across execution cycles

Key Components:

Beliefs: The agent's knowledge about the world
Desires: The agent's goals or objectives
Intentions: Specific plans the agent commits to achieve its desires
Actions: Selected tools or operations to execute intentions

Use Cases:

Complex goal planning with multiple subgoals
Tasks requiring a consistent mental model
Scenarios where prioritizing among multiple objectives is important

3. LAT (Language Agent Tree Search)
Implementation Overview:

Explores multiple solution paths through tree search algorithms
Uses simulation and backpropagation to evaluate options
Employs reflection and learning to improve decision-making

Key Components:

Decision Tree Creation: Builds a tree of possible solution paths
Node Selection: Chooses which path to explore next
Simulation: Evaluates potential outcomes of a selected path
Backpropagation: Updates previous nodes based on simulation results
Path Selection: Selects the optimal solution path

Use Cases:

Problems with multiple possible solutions
Tasks requiring exploration of different strategies
Decision-making with long-term consequences

4. RAISE (Reasoning and Acting Through Scratch Pad and Examples)
Implementation Overview:

Uses a scratch pad to maintain working memory and track reasoning
Leverages examples to guide problem-solving
Combines internal reasoning with external tool usage

Key Components:

Scratch Pad: Working memory that records all reasoning steps
Examples Retrieval: Finds relevant examples to guide reasoning
Thought Generation: Produces reasoning based on context and examples
Tool Usage: Interacts with external systems when needed
Memory Editing: Updates the scratch pad with new information

Use Cases:

Tasks requiring detailed step-by-step reasoning
Learning from examples or demonstrations
Problems where tracking the reasoning process is important

5. ReWOO (Reasoning Without Observation)
Implementation Overview:

Focuses on pure reasoning without external observations
Distributes subtasks among multiple workers
Integrates worker results to form a comprehensive solution

Key Components:

Planner: Creates a plan with subtasks for workers
Workers: Solve assigned subtasks through pure reasoning
Solver: Integrates worker results into a coherent solution

Use Cases:

Pure reasoning tasks without need for external data
Problems that can be decomposed into independent subtasks
Tasks where deep thinking is more important than external interaction

Comparison and Selection Guidelines
When choosing an agent architecture for your task:

Choose OODA when dealing with dynamic environments or when continuous reassessment is required
Choose BDI for complex goal-oriented tasks with multiple objectives or when maintaining a consistent mental model is important
Choose LAT when exploring multiple solution paths would be beneficial or when decisions have long-term consequences that need simulation
Choose RAISE when detailed step-by-step reasoning needs to be tracked or when learning from examples is important
Choose ReWOO for pure reasoning tasks without external data needs or when parallel processing of subtasks would be efficient

Each architecture in the Harkaam framework is implemented as a separate agent class that inherits from the BaseAgent, making it easy to swap architectures or combine them in multi-agent workflows.
